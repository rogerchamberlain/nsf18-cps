\FIXME{Describe broader impacts: environmental benefits of energy savings
and quality of life benefits to building occupants.}

At the undergraduate education level, this work is closely related to
\FIXME{describe CSE 132 connection}.

At the graduate education level, this work will support 4 graduate
students at Washington Univ.~in St.~Louis.
\FIXME{Expand, including REUs, multidisciplinary angle.}

We will leverage a pair of existing university programs to help us
attract students from traditionally underrepresented groups.  The Olin
Fellowship Program (for women) and the Chancellor's Fellowship Program
(aimed at underrepresented minority students) have had a successful track
record of enabling individuals to pursue graduate study.  In our
experience, the most effective method for attracting students from
underrepresented groups is by personal contact with a suitable role
model.  To facilitate this, we regularly ask the appropriately
qualified individuals in our group to be actively involved in the
recruiting process.  This cohort currently includes two
minority graduate students (one African-American student and one hispanic 
student). \FIXME{Can we strengthen the BPC story? Maybe somehow with 132
and maker spaces?}
