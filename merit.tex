\subsection{Intellectual Merit}
\label{sec:merit}

The main intellectual contributions of this proposed research entail
the development of new methods for multi-objective optimization of 
catoptric systems, i.e., rigorous techniques for deciding how a 
collection of controllable mirrors should be installed and how they 
should be positioned and (repositioned) from moment to moment.  We
will investigate not only the multi-objective control models,
policies, and mechanisms, but also issues of design for flexible
installation; ensuring safety, reliability, etc.; and exploring in
what ways catoptric systems can serve as a guiding example for more
general cyber-physical systems development.  Conducting these 
investigations will provide new insights into how MDP models can
be applied in cyber-physical-human contexts, the benefits and limitations
of doing so, and practical experience developing, evaluating, and operating
these systems.
