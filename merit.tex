\subsection{Intellectual Merit}
\label{sec:merit}

The intellectual contributions of this project are
the investigation of
methods for the multi-objective optimization of catoptric systems, i.e., deciding how a collection of
controllable mirrors should be installed and how they should be positioned from moment to moment.
We will investigate not only the multi-objective control models, policies, and mechanisms, but also
issues of design for flexible installation; ensuring safety, reliability, etc.; and exploring in what ways
catoptric systems can serve as a guiding example for more general cyber-physical systems development.
