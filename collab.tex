\FIXME{Describe the timeline.}

\subsection*{Year 1}

\begin{itemize}

\item Perform quantitative measurements on Steinberg catoptric surface.

\item Design initial MDPs, incorporating daylighting and heat harvesting.

\item Develop initial abstractions for low-level controller software.

\item Evaluate imaging approach for positioning feedback.

\item Perform initial design work for VelociData installation.

\item Submit human subjects evaluation plan to IRB for approval.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Year 2}

\begin{itemize}

\item Decommission Steinberg surface and re-purpose components for
reliability testing.

\item Expand MDPs to include additional constraints (i.e., to ensure
safety)\footnote{Note: we only operate the Steinberg surface under active human
supervision, as the automated safe operation cannot yet be ensured.}.

\item Develop initial abstractions for MDP-based optimization software.

\item Install VelociData catoptric surface and perform empirical evaluation.

\item Perform quality of experience evaluation for VelociData users.

\item Perform initial design work for BECS installation.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Year 3}

\begin{itemize}

\item Expand MDPs to include additional goals (e.g., to prioritize
reliability).

\item Install BECS catoptric surface and perform empirical evaluation.

\item Perform quality of experience evaluation for BECS users.

\item Refine software abstractions for both low-level positioning control
and high-level MDP-based optimization, based upon what has been learned
from earlier editions.

\item Release software under open source licensing terms.

\end{itemize}
