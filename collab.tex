\section{Project Management and Collaboration Plan}
\label{sec:collab}

\FIXME{Describe the team, including roles on the project.}

{\bf Roger D. Chamberlain}, PI, is Professor of Computer Science
and Engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science
at Washington University in St.~Louis.
\FIXME{Describe role.}

{\bf Chandler Ahrens}, Co-PI, is Asst.~Professor of Architecture
in the Sam Fox School of Design \& Visual Arts
at Washington University in St.~Louis.
\FIXME{Describe role.}

{\bf Chris D. Gill}, Co-PI, is Professor of Computer Science
and Engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science
at Washington University in St.~Louis.
\FIXME{Describe role.}

All three faculty have worked together in the past, so the organization
of the present collaboration will be straightforward.  Co-authored
publications with two more of the faculty
include~\cite{cag18,mgc16, mskgct13}. Chamberlain and Ahrens collaborated
on the design and implementation of the catroptic surface being
installed in Steinberg Hall, and Chamberlain and Gill have previously
co-advised a doctoral student (J.~Meier, currently at Lockheed Martin)
who exploited Markov decision processes for RF spectrum management.

\FIXME{Describe how we intend to work together on this project.}

\FIXME{Describe the timeline.}

\subsection*{Year 1}

\begin{itemize}

\item Perform quantitative measurements on Steinberg catoptric surface.

\item Design initial MDPs, incorporating daylighting and heat harvesting.

\item Develop initial abstractions for low-level controller software.

\item Evaluate imaging approach for positioning feedback.

\item Perform initial design work for VelociData installation.

\item Submit human subjects evaluation plan to IRB for approval.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Year 2}

\begin{itemize}

\item Decommission Steinberg surface and re-purpose components for
reliability testing.

\item Expand MDPs to include additional constraints (i.e., to ensure
safety)\footnote{Note: we only operate the Steinberg surface under active human
supervision, as the automated safe operation cannot yet be ensured.}.

\item Develop initial abstractions for MDP-based optimization software.

\item Install VelociData catoptric surface and perform empirical evaluation.

\item Perform quality of experience evaluation for VelociData users.

\item Perform initial design work for BECS installation.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Year 3}

\begin{itemize}

\item Expand MDPs to include additional goals (e.g., to prioritize
reliability).

\item Install BECS catoptric surface and perform empirical evaluation.

\item Perform quality of experience evaluation for BECS users.

\item Refine software abstractions for both low-level positioning control
and high-level MDP-based optimization, based upon what has been learned
from earlier editions.

\item Release software under open source licensing terms.

\end{itemize}
