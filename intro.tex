\FIXME{What are we doing?}

\FIXME{Where (if at all) should we define Open-Source Architecture (OSArc) as
distinct from open-source software? How do the notions of OSArc integrate
with what we are doing? (This is a Chandler question.) Is~\cite{BS13} a
good citation (I just found it on wikipedia)? How about one or more things that
Chandler has written?}

\FIXME{Articulate specific research questions.}

\FIXME{Brief description of who we are and what we've done.}
