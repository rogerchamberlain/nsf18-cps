\FIXME{What are we doing?}

\FIXME{Where (if at all) should we define Open-Source Architecture (OSArc) as
distinct from open-source software? How do the notions of OSArc integrate
with what we are doing? (This is a Chandler question.) Is~\cite{BS13} a
good citation (I just found it on wikipedia)? How about one or more things that
Chandler has written?}

\FIXME{Articulate specific research questions below.}

This research will investigate the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{What are the qualitative and quantitative benefits
that can be achieved for bulding daylighting and thermal management
through the use of catoptric systems?}

Issues within this question include \FIXME{talk about multi-objective control}.

\item \emph{How do we provide for the safety, reliability, maintainability, and
continued efficacy of these systems?}

\item \emph{How do we generalize the above into abstractions that can be
leveraged more broadly for arbitrary cyber-physical systems development?}

\end{enumerate}

\FIXME{Brief description of who we are and what we've done.}
