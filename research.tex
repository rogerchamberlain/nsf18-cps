\subsection{Question 1 -- What are the qualitative and quantitative benefits
that can be achieved for bulding daylighting and thermal management
through the use of catoptric systems?}

There is ample literature that documents the benefits of natural light in
human-occupied spaces~\cite{Leslie03,ll01,pce00}, yet the thermal effects
can also be significant~\cite{bmbc13} (i.e., too much sunlight can
increase temperature to an unacceptable degree).

While many studies focus on the benefits of a homogenous light levels
within a space~\cite{azaise13,bwkk15},
there is often differing need for light level based on user.
The increased control due to the independent positioning of the mirrors
can provide functional benefits for people that need more or less
light due to age of the occupant or their task. For example, someone using
a computer needs less light since the screen is a source of
artificial light while someone reading from physical media like
a book requires higher light levels. The light level required for
vision varies with the age of the occupants. As people get older,
they need higher light levels and increased luminous contrast.
Furthermore, everyone regardless of age have different qualities
of vision. Therefore, having a system that can accommodate these
varying conditions using daylight rather than artificial light is beneficial.

For thermal management, the literature on harvesting sunlight for space
heating is substantial (see, e.g.,~\cite{deW75,Hunt79,kbd76,Lunde80,smf08,wo06},
and we do not propose to contribute anything
new to that field.  We will simply leverage what are already well-understood
techniques. It is worth acknowledging that many sunlight-based heating systems
use catoptric systems (primarily for sun tracking). Our contributions here
will be to integrate a sunlight harvesting system into dual-purpose use, both
heating and illumination.

We will explore the use of Markov decision processes for multi-objective
control of catoptric systems.  We will start with a single objective,
matching a provided image map that represents a desired illumination pattern,
and then generalize to include the competing goal of thermal energy
harvesting.

For the purpose of designing an MDP, we will assume that a low-level
control mechanism exists that can position each individual mirror as
desired.  The MDP will model the higher-level management issues, e.g.,
which mirror should be pointed in which direction?
With a low-level controller in place, the state space, $\mathcal{X}$,
can encapsulate the set of mirrors pointed at each position in
the image map.  The set of actions, $\mathcal{A}$, will embody the movement
of one or more mirrors from their present position to a new position,
and the transition system, $T$, will encode the probablistic variations
present in the available sunlight.  This allows the reward function, $R$,
to be a quantified match between the desired image map and the resulting
daylight that is directed to each position in the physical space.

After an initial exploration of the MDP formulated as described above,
we will then proceed to expand the framework to include the additional
objective of harvesting heat.  We will quantify the benefits of each
objective using general utility functions~\cite{tggs10} in a manner previously
explored by our group. One candidate set of utility functions we will
investigate will be to prioritize daylighting performance, and only
allocate excess sunlight to the HVAC subsystem. A second alternative
will be to proportionally provide sunlight to each goal up to the point
that the illumination can no longer benefit, at which point all additionally
available sunlight goes into heating.

In each of the above MDPs under investigation, we will utilize the
value-optimal solution (guaranteed to exist within Markov decision process
theory); however, this solution typically must be computed off-line, since
it is, in general, exponentially expensive to compute.  In parallel, we
will explore the space of value-optimal solutions and seek to formulate
an inexpensive to compute heuristic that closely approximates the
true value-optimal solution.

\subsection{Question 2 -- How do we provide for the safety, reliability,
maintainability, and continued efficacy of these systems?}

The ability to control mirror position is only useful over time if
the additional considerations of safety, reliability, etc., are managed
properly for the system as a whole. To address these issues, we will
investigate the degree to which they can be handled within the context
of the low-level controller versus being dealt with within the high-level
complete system control.

\FIXME{The interesting thing here is how properties like safety are 
dependent on context, e.g., we want concentrated natural light when harvesting
energy but not when illuminating a human-occupied space.}

\subsection{Question 3}

\FIXME{We will investigate the viability and utility of two candidate
abstractions: direct mirror control and MDP control~\cite{cac18}.}
