\subsection{Question 1 -- What are the qualitative and quantitative benefits
that can be achieved for bulding daylighting and thermal management
through the use of catoptric systems?}

There is ample literature that documents the benefits of natural light in
human-occupied spaces~\cite{Leslie03,ll01,pce00}, yet the thermal effects
can also be significant~\cite{bmbc13} (i.e., too much sunlight can
increase temperature to an unacceptable degree).

\FIXME{We will explore the use of MDPs for multi-objective control
of catoptric systems.}

\FIXME{Describe our three previous uses of MDPs, and how the value-optimal
solution can be estimated heuristically in each case. Chris, can you
take a first crack at this?}

\FIXME{Describe our approach to applying MDPs to catroptic system control.
This includes quantification of benefits, formulation of a combined
objective, identifying the control degrees of freedom, encapsulating all
of the above in an MDP framework, exploring the MDP state space, seeking
to find a heuristic that approximates the value-optimal solution.}

\subsection{Question 2}

\FIXME{The interesting thing here is how properties like safety are 
dependent on context, e.g., we want concentrated natural light when harvesting
energy but not when illuminating a human-occupied space.}

\subsection{Question 3}

\FIXME{We will investigate the viability and utility of two candidate
abstractions: direct mirror control and MDP control.}
