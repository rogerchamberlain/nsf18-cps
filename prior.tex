{\large\bf CSR: Small: Concurrent Accelerated Data Integration}
{\bf (CNS-1527510,
PI: R. Chamberlain)}, 
10/2015--9/2019, \$519,275.  

\textbf{Intellectual Merit} -- This project investigates the
accelerated execution of data integration workflows, which
increasingly are bottlenecks in data science. Execution platforms
being targeted include both graphics engines and FPGAs.  Publications
resulting from this work include~\cite{dibs,c17,mgc16,js16}.

\textbf{Broader Impacts} -- This research project has supported 3
graduate students and 4 REU students.  The applications investigated
come from the fields of computational biology, astrophysics, and the
Internet of Things, further expanding the scope of the students'
experience.  A benchmark suite of these workflows has been released
as a community resource~\cite{dibsv1}.

{\large\bf Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array (VERITAS) Project}
{\bf (J. Buckley)}

This work was covered by a combination of a DOE research grant as well
as project funds in the form of DOE and NSF/Physics subcontracts
through the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory project office.

\textbf{Intellectual Merit} -- Significant products of the
work include the VERITAS FADC electronics and a number of scientific
results summarized in
\cite{2016MNRAS.461..202A,2016arXiv160901692A,2016arXiv160806464A,2016arXiv160801569A,2016MNRAS.459.2550A,2016ApJ...821..129A,2016ApJ...819..156B,2016ApJ...818L..33A,2016ApJ...817L...7A,2015ApJ...815L..22A,2015PhRvL.115u1103C,2015PhRvD..91l9903A,2015A&A...578A..22A,2015A&A...576A.126A,2015PDU.....7...16B,2015ApJ...800...61A,2015ApJ...799....7A,2014ApJ...797...89A,2014ApJ...795L...3A,2014ApJ...790..149A,2014ApJ...788..158A,2014ApJ...788...78A,2014ApJ...787..166A,2014ApJ...783...16A,2014ApJ...782...13A,2014APh....54....1A,2014arXiv1401.6085F,2014ApJ...780..168A,2013ApJ...779...92A,2013arXiv1310.8621A,2013arXiv1310.7040B,2013arXiv1310.5662B,2013ApJ...776...69A,2013arXiv1308.6173V,2013arXiv1307.4962P,2013arXiv1307.2807D,2013ApJ...770...93A,2013arXiv1305.0302W,2013arXiv1304.6367S,2013APh....43....3A,2013ApJ...764...38A,2013ApJ...762...92A}.
A founding member of VERITAS, Dr.\ Buckley was responsible for the design
and construction of the 2000-channel 500 Msps VERITAS FADC system.
He also played a leading role in establishing the scientific
programs for dark matter, multiwavelength studies of active galaxies
and observations of supernova remnants. Scientific highlights of
VERITAS include (1) DM limits on dwarf
galaxies\cite{2017PhRvD..95h2001A,2015PhRvD..91l9903A,2012PhRvD..85f2001A},
(2) resolved images and spectra from supernova remnants (SNR) leading
to direct evidence for the origin of hadronic cosmic rays in SNR
\cite{2017ApJ...836...23A,2013ApJ...764...38A,2013ApJ...770...93A,2010ApJ...719L..69A,2009ApJ...698L.133A},
(3) discovery of periodic emission from the Crab pulsar up to $>$100
GeV challenging current models of pulsar magnetospheres
\cite{2011Sci...334...69V}), (4) measurements of spectral variability
of active galaxies (AGNs) with multiwavelength data providing new
constraints on conditions near the central supermassive black hole
(e.g.,
\cite{2009ApJ...707..612A,2008ApJ...684L..73A,2011ApJ...726...43A,2009ApJ...691L..13D,2017ApJ...834....2A})
and (5) constraints on the extragalactic background light,
Lorentz-invariance violation and intergalactic magnetic fields
\cite{2012ApJ...750...94A,2010ApJ...708L.100A}.

\textbf{Broader Impacts} -- Information on VERITAS was disseminated to the
general public through YouTube videos, public site tours, and informational
displays at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatories.
